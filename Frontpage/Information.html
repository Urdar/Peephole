                Peephole is a ASP.NET/MSSQL web application that is design to be vulnerable.

                The main goal is for beginners and developers to test their skills in an legal environment.

                We want professional, students and other people to better their understanding in web security to make the web a safer place.

                <p>A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by the Board of or senior governance body within an organization whereas procedures or protocols would be developed and adopted by senior executive officers.

                <h2>Confidentiality, Integrity and Accessibility</h2>
                <p><b>When dealing with sensitive information, providing security is imporant. Providing confidentiality, integrity and accessibility is just as important!</b></p>
                <p>The act of providing trust of the information, that the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of the information are not violated. E.g., ensuring that data is not lost when critical issues arise. These issues include, but are not limited to: natural disasters, computer/server malfunction, physical theft, or any other instance where data has the potential of being lost. Since most information is stored on computers in our modern era, information assurance is typically dealt with by IT security specialists. A common method of providing information assurance is to have an off-site backup of the data in case one of the mentioned issues arise.

                        Confidentiality
                    </b>
                    refers to when information is protected from disclosure or exposure to unauthorized individuals. Confidentiality ensures that only the person with the right privileges have access to the given information. If someone unauthorized access get access, the confidentiality is breached. There are several ways to secure information, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information classification</li>
                        <li>Secure document storage</li>
                        <li>Application of general security policies</li>
                        <li>Training employees</li>

                        Integrity
                    </b>
                    refers to maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle and is a critical aspect to the design, implementation and usage of any system which stores, processes or retrieves data. Integrity could be broken if the system/information does not longer have confidentiality or may be leaked/exploited (either physical or digital). If a system is malfunction that could mean that integrity is broken. This means that the system could not be trusted, you could never know if you get the data you are looking for, and in the worst case you might get wrong data if the system is malfunctioning.

                        Accessibility
                    </b>
                    refers to which a system, subsystem or equipment is in a specified operable and committable state at the start of a mission, when the mission is called for at a random time. Often we use the term mission capable rate, which means 100% uptime minus unavailability. This refers to when the caregivers had unavailability of the registry data. They could never know if the data they want would show up. This means that the caregivers uses a system that they cannot trust and is unreliable. A system that is not trustworthy is not a good system, since I would possibly lead to more work and frustration.

                <h2>Hashing</h2>
                <p> cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (a hash function) which is designed to also be one-way function, that is, a function which is infeasible to invert. The only way to recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function's output is to try a large number of possible inputs to see if they produce a match.

                <p>
                    There's a lot of different hashing algorithms, some are older an insecure (but still in use). Others are newer and secure. Please check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm">Wikipedia</a> for a detailed list of hashing algorithms.
